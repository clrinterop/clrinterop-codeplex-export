    "Description": "The -help description for SigImp indicates that it can accept multiple header files for processing. However, when attempting to use this feature I found that only the first header file would be processed. I found the problem in the ProcessHeaderFiles() function of Module1.vb.\n\nThis line:\nwriter.Write(\"#include \"\"{0}\"\"\", p)\nShould be changed to:\nwriter.WriteLine(\"#include \"\"{0}\"\"\", p)\n\nThis ensures that each #include statement written to the temporary file is written to its own line, which allows the preprocessor to properly parse them.",

    "Description": "With the new version we are able to map all references to the local IStream definition to System.Runtime.InteropServices.ComTypes.IStream. \nUnfortunately the now unreferenced local IStream definition, as well as ISequentialStream, _ULARGE_INTEGER etc. are still part of the Interop.\nAs it is very annoying and confusing have multiple unsused IStream or other type definitions around it would be a nice feature to be able to suppress some types from going into the Interop.",

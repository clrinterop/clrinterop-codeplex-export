    "Html": "Hi,<br>\r\nThank you for your suggestion. Currently TlbImp2 does use the type library name as the output assembly name. Using your example, &quot;TlbImp2 MyComFile.dll&quot; will create &quot;TlbName.dll&quot;. The reason we are not creating &quot;Interop.TlbName.dll&quot; is that 1) It would break existing applications that expect &quot;TlbName.dll&quot; 2) The assembly name would be inconsistent with the namespace, as with such dll you would expect the namespace to be &quot;Interop.TlbName&quot;, which is actually &quot;TlbName&quot;. Could you please explain why existing TlbImp behavior doesn't work for you and could you please provide specific scenarios for us to look into?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThanks,<br>\r\nYi\r\n",

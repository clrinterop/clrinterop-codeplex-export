    "Html": "<p>The Application I'm currently working on is basically a .NET Application acting as an COM EXE-Server (localserver32) which exposes its Object Model and an ActiveX-Control to COM. The Exe is written in ATL and implements the Application Class of the Object Model (The Exe don't really do much, it is basically a loader for the much larger .NET part). The rest of the Object Model is implemented in a seperate c# DLL which is COM-Visible and its TypeLib is generated by tlbexp (and registered together with the Exe, not with regasm).</p>\r\n<p>Everything works fine in Access or VB6, but tlbimp.exe and TlbImp2.exe don't allow the creation of interop DLLs from a TypeLibs generated from a c# DLLs. So the Object Model could not be used in an .NET App.</p>\r\n<p>It doesn't make sense to use a TypeLib from a .NET DLL in an in-process scenario, but in an out-of-process scenario it is the only way.</p>\r\n<p>Is there an other way to solve this problem?</p>",

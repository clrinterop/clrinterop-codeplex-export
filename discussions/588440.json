When connxions client, I realize that my listener is firstly in &quot;Established&quot; with his client and at the same time remains in &quot;listenning.&quot; This situation means that when the client socket is cut, it also carries the listening socket. Is this normal? Is there a way to keep the listening socket always open in &quot;listenning&quot; and connect the client socket on a port, as with VB6?\r<br />\n<br />\nThx.<br />\n",
